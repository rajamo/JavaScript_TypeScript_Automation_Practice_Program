/*TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. 
It is designed to help developers catch errors early in the development process and improve code maintainability.
TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript, which can then be executed in any JavaScript environment.

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime. 
This flexibility can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug.
TypeScript, on the other hand, introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
This helps catch type-related errors during development, leading to more robust and reliable code.

B =123
A = 1234567
A is super set of B

basic Features of TypeScript:
1. Static Typing: TypeScript allows you to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which helps catch type-related errors during development
(compile time not runtime).
2. Interfaces: TypeScript provides interfaces to define the shape of objects, making it easier to work with complex data structures.
3. Classes and Inheritance: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, and access modifiers (public, private, protected).
4. Generics: TypeScript supports generics, allowing you to create reusable components that work with different data types while maintaining type safety.
5. Type Inference: TypeScript can automatically infer types based on the assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations in many cases.
6. Modules: TypeScript supports ES6 module syntax, allowing you to organize your code into reusable modules.
7. Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript has excellent tooling support, including integration with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code, which provides features
 like autocompletion, refactoring, and error checking.
8. Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript is designed to be compatible with existing JavaScript code, allowing you to gradually adopt TypeScript in your projects.
9. Advanced Type Features: TypeScript includes advanced type features like union types, intersection types, type guards, and mapped types, 
which provide greater flexibility in defining types.
10. Decorators: TypeScript supports decorators, which are a way to add metadata and modify the behavior of classes and class members.
Overall, TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static typing and other features that improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.
